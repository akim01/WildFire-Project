# WildFire-Project
##Problem
Massive wildfires are destroying homes and habitats aroudn the world. With wildfires, early detection and prevention becomes key to containing the fire.
Most recently Australia's bush fire has been estimated to have taken 1.25 billion animal life. The late 2018 Woolsley fire in California has detsroyed more than 1500 building.

##Solution
States like California and Nevada has set up surveillance cameras along wildfire hotspots. These cameras are monitored by volunteers during peak season. However we believe that these can be automated by the help of machine learning algorithms.

What this project aims to do is to detect fires from surveillance footage using convolutional neural networks.
